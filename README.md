# wp_plugin
A Wordpress Plugin that creates a complete web directory (with categories, links, management) that pools and aggregates the web traffic of the members into a larger, more valuable block of traffic. Installation enables members with agency relationship to sell the aggregate for long-term commissions.

You need to be a registered advertiser in the manna network (free) to configure the plugin.

If you are not registered then (preferrably) do so at the website where you found out about the Manna network or visit Manna-Network.com/register.php and select one of the major members.
