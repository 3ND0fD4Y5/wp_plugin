echo '<h2>Auto-Detecting Your Configuration Settings</h2><h3 style="color:red;">We were able to detect that your website "'.$http_host.' is registered as an advertiser BUT it is still pending administrative review (as is performed for all new advertisers). This <b>will NOT</b> affect the operation of the plugin (i.e. advertisers can still register in the network from your plugin) but your ad will not be displayed until your site is approved. The review process of new ads is usually completed within 24-48 hours and this notice will no longer appear.</h3>';
